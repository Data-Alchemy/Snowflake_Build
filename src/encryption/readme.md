Creating an External Key Management (EKM) provider in Snowflake can be done in several steps:

Create an EKM provider: This can be done by running a SQL statement to create the EKM provider.

Grant access to the EKM provider: This can be done by running a SQL statement to grant access to the EKM provider to a specific role or user.

Use the EKM provider to encrypt and decrypt data: This can be done by running SQL statements to encrypt and decrypt data using the EKM provider.

Here is an example of how to create an EKM provider in Snowflake:

Copy code
```
-- Create the EKM provider
CREATE EKM PROVIDER azure_key_vault
    TYPE = 'AZURE_KEY_VAULT'
    CREDENTIALS = (
        client_id='Your_Client_ID',
        client_secret='Your_Client_Secret',
        tenant_id='Your_Tenant_ID',
        key_vault_uri='Your_Key_Vault_URI'
    );
```
This example creates an EKM provider called azure_key_vault, and uses the AZURE_KEY_VAULT type. The CREDENTIALS parameter is used to provide the necessary credentials for Snowflake to access the key vault in Azure.

It's worth noting that, you should use the correct credentials for your Azure Key Vault, and make sure that the External Key Management (EKM) feature is enabled in your Snowflake account.
You should also ensure that the communication between Snowflake and Azure Key Vault is over a secure channel, and that you have proper security measures in place to protect the data and the keys.
Also, it's a best practice to use a different key for each table or column, also to use a secure way of storing the key and rotate it regularly.

Once you have created the EKM provider, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt data by running SQL statements such as:

Copy code
```
--Encrypt data
SELECT ENCRYPT(data, 'my_provider', 'Your_Password');
```

--Decrypt data
SELECT DECRYPT(data, 'my_provider', 'Your_Password');
It's worth noting that, you should use a strong and unique password, and make sure that the External Key Management (EKM) feature is enabled in your Snowflake account.
